# Roadbook Recorder

## Description

You may have heard of a roadbook being used by rally drivers in such events as the Dakar Rally. A roadbook is arranged in the form of a table. Each line describes a significant point on the route, for example, a crossroads, a fork, a curiosity to see or a dangerous point.

Instead of designing the roadbooks by hand, Roadbook Recorder offers an easy solution for automatic generation of these tables, making it convenient for rally organizers.

## How it works

Initially, the route is covered with a means of transport, so that GPS coordinates are recorded. For data processing, a new layer is added from Googlr Maps / OpenStreet Maps. Visual analysis is done on the image.

An AI algorithm detects intersections on the map and automatically generates waypoints for the Roadbook. Other waypoints can be added manually. Distances are automatically calculated from the recorded track.

## Customer segments

The Roadbook Recorder solution is to be used by rally organizers, in the process of generating Roadbooks.

## Competition

### Seekers

An application that allows the user to import a GPX track and to convert that track to a route. This will match the track to roads, detect off-road sections and integrate waypoints to be reached.

### Rally Navigator

An application that allows the user to manually trace the desired route on a map and to design and edit the Roadbook based on it.

## Why Roadbook Recorder

The functionality of Roadbook Recorder is based on atrificial intelligence, so that the generation process is faster, easier, and requires minimum interaction from the user's end.
