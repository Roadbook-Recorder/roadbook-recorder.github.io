<div style="text-align: left"> Roadbook Recorder's revenue comes from the roadbook generations that are carried out through the implemented application.
<br />
<br />
    For a user, the first 3 roadbook generations are free. After that, all generations will be paid for.
<br />
<br />
    Our application will also host advertisements. Apart from basic roadbook generation, some extra features will be paid for. These features are:
<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>downloading a PDF version of the generated roadbook.</li>
    <li>editing a generated roadbook.</li>
</ul>
</div>
