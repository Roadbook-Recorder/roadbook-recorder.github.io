<div style="text-align: left"> 
    <ul>
        <li>Initially, the route is covered with a means of transport, so that GPS coordinates are recorded.</li>
        <li>A GXP file is generated using any GPS map app, like OruxMaps.</li>
        <li>The GPX file is imported in the Roadbook Recorder app.</li>
        <li>The mobile app relies on a server that will process the GPX and will generate the roadbook.</li>
        <li>The roadbook is displayed in the app.</li>
        <li>The user can scroll up or down through the document while navigating.</li>
        <li>If needed, the document can be manually edited by double tapping on any sections.</li>
    </ul>
