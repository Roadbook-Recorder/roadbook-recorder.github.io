<div style="text-align: justify">
    We reached out to a few groups of bikers and we asked them to fill in a form for us. With this form that we shared, we were loooking to find out about these people's experiences with roadbook navigation.

    <br />
    <br />

    First, we were interested in seeing how many of these motorsport enthusiasts have actually used a roadbook before. For those who gave a positive response, we asked about the context in which they used the roadbook - was it just for personal use or was it for an organized event? We also asked about the way these people got their roadbooks - did they personally generate them, or were they given to them? For those who said they never used a roadbook before, we wanted to know the reason why - was it lack of interest, or lack of knowledge / resources?

    Below there are some screenshots of the response statistics:
